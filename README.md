### Package file protocol

To add new packages/upgrade packages, submit a package file as a pull request on this repository. When other developers deem it ready, they will merge it into the canary branch.

If after enough time (about a week), a package has had no serious bugs filed against, it can be moved into the testing branch. Currently we have no stable branch as we don't have enough developers to manage moving all those package files around.
